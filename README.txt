tibs are tiny payments typically around 15p/25c. This plugin makes collecting tibs simple.

=== Description ===
# Description

## tib 
/tɪb/  
*pl.* tibs,  *v.tr* tibbed  
*s.a.* tibber, tibbee

**noun:**  
A small online payment, typically around 15p (25¢), sent by a tibber to a tibbee, either as payment for access to content or a service, or as a gratuity.

**verb:**  
A request to tibdit to transfer a micro-payment, with a value previously specified by the tibber, to the tibbee.

## tibdit
tibdit provides a simple, original approach to collecting micropayments from visitors.

Users, or *tibbers*, pre-define their *tib* amount with a value where they 'won't have to think twice', and purchase a bundle of these tibs.

Publishers, or *tibbees* can collect tibs from tibbers simply by linking to the tibdit web application from their site.  There is no need to register or create any sort of account with tibdit to use our system to collect micropayments and microdonations through our service.  All that is required is a bitcoin address. Links to some suggested ways obtain one are included in the instructions on the dashboard settings page.

This plugin automates the process for WordPress site operators, including the receipt and processing of the token returned from the tibdit application which acknowledges the payment of a tib and displays a count of tibs received.   This counter can be site-wide, widget-specific, or post-specific.

== Installation ==
#Installation

1. If required, manually extract te files to wp-content/plugins/tibdit - this step can be skipped for automated installs.  

1. Activate the tibdit plugin from the Plugins menu in your WordPress dashboard.  

1. Go to the tibdit page in the Settings menu of the dashboard, read through the instructions there, and configure:  
    * A title and intro text to appear when the widget is used
    * Your bitcoin address
    * How many days the site should acknowlege a users tib (for that user, the button is deactivated and a tickmark is overlayed)  
    
1. Place the widget, or the shortcodes [tib_post] and [tib_site] at the places on your site you wish to display the tib button  


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
## Questions
### what is the difference between [tib_post] and [tib_site] 

The `[tib_post]` shortcode passes a subreference of `"WP_ID_nnn"` to tibdit, so it is the particular post with id of `nnn` that is being tibbed, and this post that the counter will track.   Per-post counters are persisted in post metadata.

Conversely `[tib_site]` passes a subreference of `"WP_SITE"` and the counter will be for the total number of tibs with that subreference.  The counter is persisted in the WordPress site options data.

### what about the Widget 

The widget also uses the options data to record the count of tibs, but you can specify a different subreference for each widget, giving each it's own counter, or share a subreference, or specify `"WP_SITE"` if you wish.  The widget also lets you specify widget-specific headings, and a widget-specific bitcoin address - although this is not recommended.

### how do the counters get set 

Every time someone confirms a tib to some content of yours, we send back a token, which is collected and processed by the Plugin. This token includes the total accumulated tibs for the unique combination of bitcoin address and subreference.


== Screenshots ==
##Screenshots

1. The tib button in action.  These examples are 'testmode', the yellow beaker is shown only when the plugin is configured with a bitcoin testnet address.  

2. When a tib button is clicked, the tibdit application opens in a new window/tab (popup where allowed).  If the user is an existing user with a balance of unspent tibs, they are taken directly to the tib confirmation stage.  

3. After the user confirms the tib, the popup window is closed, which triggers the WordPress window to refresh.  Any paid-for content is revealed, and the tib button is replaced by a static acknowledgement of the tib being received.  

4. This is the tibdit page within the Dashboard Settings menu.
